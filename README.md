# myprojects
This repository is a demonstration of the skill I have acquired through my college career. This file is to give an explanation of the skills and will be broken down
by project. There are zip files in this repository that also contain documents from websites that will highlight that I know how to document the work that goes into
the processes of building a website as well.

*****Cost Calculator*****
This application demonstrates my experience with the C#. The purpose of this application was to build a simple Graphic User Inferface that acts as a calculator.
This calculator is specific to variables that are unique to the cost of carpet installation with the user provided inputs that are required for the application to 
operate correctly.

*****Data Tool*****
This application demonstrates my experience with Python. The purpose of this applicationis to hardcode a sample set of data. The program has data analysis tools coded into
the application that will pull min, max, median, mode, and variance from the sample data hard coded in the application. This application has utilizes the seaborn function
that allows the application to provide a graphical representation of the data as well. This application was coded through the coding tool spyder from andaconda navigator, so
it is recommended to view the application through this coding environment.

*****Case Study*****
The case study folder contains two case write ups in which I was given case studies to analyze. The goal of the writes is to demonstrate the critical thinking aspect
behind the failures of technology and to come up with solution that I felt could have been integrated into the companies to prevent the issue from happening. Each case
write up is unique to itself, but I feel these documents demonstrate my ability to think outside the box and plan for unexpected events under different scenarios.

*****Website Projects*****
The website projects folder provides a couple different websites that I had worked on in my time at the University of Louisville. The planned website was a website that was
demonstrating my ability to work within a group to provide a plan of a website to pitch to a client. The document contains all of the planning and materials used during the 
planning phases of the development life cycle.

The Blue Ridge file provides the website that had been developed within my group for an animal shelter. The file is provided in the document format as there are file embedded
objects in the document for viewing purposes by the click of the object. This project I am proud of because I was task with the planning and the documentation of the project
throughout the development and launch of the website. I feel that this demonstrates my components in documenting and certain skill sets that align with the role of a project
manager.

*****Investigation File*****
This project tasked me with a file I recieved that is basically a tampered file. Some of the files had been deleted from a personal computer of an individual suspected to
have been involved with a crime(hypothetical scenario). This document is a report of the findings that I had recovered from the files using a few different tools to extract
data from the files. This demonstrates my ability to investigate a Personal computer allow specific to a hypothetical situation I believe this helped develop my critical thinking
that could be used in other aspect of the technology field.
